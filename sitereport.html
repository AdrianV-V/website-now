    <p>
      During this module, I picked up the fundamentals of web development, starting from crafting simple HTML pages to enhancing them with CSS and making them responsive. At first, it felt a bit daunting to keep track of all the various tags and CSS properties, but I soon realized how exciting and creative web development can be.

One of my major achievements was mastering Grid for arranging elements in a clean and responsive way. It provided me with greater control over the user interface and enabled me to create a visually appealing projects page. However, I faced some challenges with debugging layout problems when elements would overlap or misalign on smaller screens. I managed to resolve those issues by leveraging my previous knowledge and rewatching the videos from earlier lessons. I also incorporated accent colors like blue to highlight links and buttons.
